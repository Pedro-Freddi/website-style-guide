# Website Style Guide

This project is part of **Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path's** challenge projects.

The objective was to build a fictional design guide for a website, specifying colors, fonts, headings and other element's styles to be used in its development.

It was a great opportunity to practice introductory HTML and CSS concepts.
